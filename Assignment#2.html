    <p style="margin-left:  250px;margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 20px;"> <b> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered <br> 
        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>randomized words</u>  which don't look even slightly <br> 
        believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <br>
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat <br>
        predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i>It uses a dictionary of over<br> 
        200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks<br>
        reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non- <br> 
        characteristic words etc. <br></p>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2opx; margin-left: 250px;">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 250px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Lorem Ipsum </b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br> 
    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> 
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>
    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br> 
   <b><u>Aldus PageMaker</b></u> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum.</u> 1914 translation by H. Rackham<br><br><br>
   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore <br> 
   et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi <br>
   ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse <br>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 250px;">Why do we use it?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-left: 250px; margin-top: 30px;">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its <br>
    layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br>
    using “Content here, content here”, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and <br>
    web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem Ipsum” will uncover <br>
    many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> 
    sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</p> <hr style="color: blueviolet; margin: auto;">
